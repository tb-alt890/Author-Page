      <h3>Night Talon</h3>
      <p>A gripping military tale of survival and betrayal. Enter Svalbard, Norway, an arctic archipelago swallowed by endless white. Night Talon is tasked with extracting a rogue lab researcher. A simple grab-and-go. Routine. Clean. But when Dark and the rest of Night Talon drop into the blizzard, they discover their “routine” mission is a setup. Their target isn’t alone, he has enlisted a hostile militia who awaits them in the storm, outnumbering Talon three to one. </p>
      <p>As bullets slice through the whiteout and the blizzard freezes any plans they had, Dark - Talon's sniper, becomes the hunted as he's forced to fight for his life in a frostbitten wasteland.  </p>
      <p>Upcoming 2026...</p>
